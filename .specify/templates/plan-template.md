# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**I. Code Quality Standards**
- [ ] Feature design supports single responsibility (no classes >300 lines justified)
- [ ] Error handling strategy defined (no silent failures)
- [ ] Type safety approach documented (strict typing enabled)
- [ ] Code review process planned

**II. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**
- [ ] Test scenarios written and stakeholder-approved BEFORE implementation
- [ ] Contract tests planned for all APIs/schemas
- [ ] Integration tests planned for user journeys
- [ ] Unit test coverage target >80% defined
- [ ] Tests are deterministic and fast (<100ms per unit test)

**III. User Experience Consistency**
- [ ] Design system compliance verified (UI components approved)
- [ ] Accessibility requirements documented (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Responsive design tested (320px, 768px, 1920px viewports)
- [ ] Loading states and feedback mechanisms designed
- [ ] Error messages are actionable and user-friendly
- [ ] Internationalization (i18n) keys planned (no hardcoded text)

**IV. Performance Requirements**
- [ ] Performance benchmarks defined for this feature
  - Page load times: FCP <1.5s, TTI <3s, LCP <2.5s (if UI)
  - API response times: Read <200ms p95, Write <500ms p95 (if backend)
- [ ] Resource budgets assessed (JS bundle <300KB, images <200KB)
- [ ] Database query optimization planned (no N+1, indexes reviewed)
- [ ] Caching strategy defined with TTLs
- [ ] Performance monitoring/alerting configured

**Complexity Justification Required If:**
- Any component exceeds size limits without documented rationale
- Performance benchmarks cannot be met (requires optimization plan)
- Accessibility requirements need exceptions (requires UX approval)
- Test coverage falls below 80% (requires explicit justification)

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
